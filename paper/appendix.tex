\section{Injection Measurements}
We injected the copper a distance of 1.16m (according to the spiral length calculator at http://www.giangrandi.ch/soft/spiral/spiral.shtml ) in a spiral whose cross-section was a square of area $9mm^2$.  I suspect that is about as far as we can go without using a vacuum at the end.

\section{Objet 260 Connex Digital Materials}
Softer materials (concentration of > 65% Tango-series material) do not easily accept the copper paint (it cracks when bent and is easy to wash off).  This may preclude flex sensors made of interior copper paint (conductive thread or other materials may be able to be used for some parts of this).
