\section{Introduction}
Makers, as well as professional designers, leverage 3D printers as tools for design work.  A wide array of objects, ranging from bicycle helmets to jewelry to video game controllers, are now prototyped or even manufactured using these machines.  However, most devices fabricated by 3D printers are passive: accessible printers are not yet capable of creating integrated active systems.

Willis, et al., ``envision a future world where interactive devices can be printed rather than assembled; a world where a device with active components is created as a single object, rather than a case enclosing circuit boards and individually assembled parts" \cite{Willis-printedoptics}.  This is a vision we eagerly share: 3D printers are capable of greating arbitrary geometries not feasible to manufacture using traditional processes, and we see these capabilities being underutilized by makers and designers.  We see many opportunitities to increase the interactivity of 3D prints using today's printer technology.

Using specially modified printers or extra machinery, it is possible to create electronics on the surface of 3D prints \cite{optomec} \cite{Sells-reprap}.  These techniques, however, require a high capital investment and technical expertise.  In addition, they lack flexibility: the printed circuits must be routed in 2D to be created on the objects' manifold exteriors, and they can only be used to create electronic circuits. \valkyrie{what?}

In addition to electronics, many other means of interactivity exist.

\valkyrie{Points to hit: there is more than electronics to worry about, like fluids and the organic haptic feedback they afford; tangible interfaces are important (do I have to say this every time??); assembly sucks}
