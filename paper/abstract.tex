3D printers offer extraordinary flexibilty in prototyping the shape and mechanical function of objects.  However, in spite of recent work, a 3D printer's role in prototyping \emph{interactivity} is still not clear.  While macro-scale digital fabrication devices cannot manufacture electronics in-place, there have been many clever approaches to redirecting interaction onto 3D prints.  We describe the design space of tubes and hollow chambers for interaction design: there are a variety of types, topologies, and inserted media for tubes that can be leveraged to create diverse inputs and outputs.  We present a technique and design tool for routing tubes of various topologies through the interior of 3D printed parts.  Our design tool is integrated into a 3D model manipulation program.  It allows users to select begin and end points for tubes, then uses A* path routing and physics-based simulation to minimize the bending energy of routed paths.  We present several totally tubular prototypes we created using this tool to show its flexibility and potential, as well as to explore new points in the tube design space.
