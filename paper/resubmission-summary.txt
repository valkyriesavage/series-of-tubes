CONTRIBUTION CLAIM OVERREACH (R1,R2)
We have updated our contribution claims to focus on high-level path planning rather than tubes as a technique.

ALGORITHMIC CONTRIBUTION (1AC,R1,R2)
We have updated our discussion section to include descriptions of possible solutions for the algorithmic limitations pointed out by R1, as well as outlined the larger problem of global optimization.

COMPLEX PIPE GEOMETRIES (R1)
We have added an additional figure to illustrate routing through a genus > 0 object, an object which is long and thin, and an object with many pipes that are "tangled."

SPECULATIVE OBJECTS SECTION (1AC)
We have removed this section.

SUPPORT MATERIAL DISCUSSION (1AC,R2)
We have shortened this section and clarified suggestions for future researchers to replicate our work.

VOXELIZATION VS. MESH BOOLEANS (R1)
We have added additional emphasis that voxelization allowed us flexibility for, e.g., capping.

SUNDRY CORRECTIONS/SUGGESTIONS (R2)
Again, we are very appreciative of this list, and have incorporated these changes, including a reference for Mr. Stevens.
