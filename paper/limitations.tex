\section{Limitations}
Issues of drying time for fluids in long tubes.  Flexible material doesn't work forever.  Water in Objet prints discolors them.  Can be difficult to get certain materials through certain kinds of tubes.  Makerbot tubes must be at particular angles for printing (w/o support).  Some tubes are hard to clear on Objet.
