\section{Related Work}

Our work is related to three existing research areas: fabrication, interaction techniques, and routing.

\subsection{Fabrication}

Previous work has investigated the integration of interactivity into the fabrication process.  \cite{Willis-printedoptics} used light pipes, solid clear tubes, to create integrated displays.  \cite{Savage-sauron} investigated the use of computer vision to track interactions with physical mechanisms.
\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{Savage-sauron} - Sauron.  computer vision of mechanical components obviates electronics installation.
\item \cite{Willis-infrastructs} - InfraStructs, identification of 3d printed objects using Terahertz imaging
\item \cite{Willis-printedoptics} - Printed Optics.  doing cool stuff with clear material (touch sensing and display)
\item \cite{Slyper-pressure} - robots that are made of squishy stuff where air pressure changes are sensed.  input components designed to react to different manipulations (pushing, squeezing, twisting, etc.)
\item \cite{Navarrette-gps} - I'm a little unclear on what they did, but they fabbed something with a "3D circuitboard" that has a bypass that goes into 3D.  they don't offer a routing algorithm or anything, though.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Printing Electronics}
\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{Sarik-tracebrush} - this uses an airspray machine to add conductive paths to surface of 3D prints
\item \cite{Optomec} - fancy machines that spray conductive film
\item \cite{Sells-reprap} - the RepRap people using a syringe of hot solder to squirt flat circuits into flat channels
\item \cite{icecats-conductivepaint} - an instructable I followed to make my first batch of conductive paint
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Routing}
\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{Savage-midas} - Midas.  routing in 2D to connect up capacitive sensors
\item \cite{Park-microchannels} - similar to injection of liquid metal, above
\item \cite{Majidi-curvature} - inject liquid metal into really thin tubes in a soft substrate, sense stretching by changing resistance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interaction Techniques}
\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{Sato-touche} - Touch\'{e}.  It's like Touch\'{e} with sound, but without sound.  SFCS.
\item \cite{Harrison-buttons} - fabricate latex + acrylic buttons and pressurize with air
\item \cite{Sodhi-aireal} - air vortex generation in free space.  air haptics.
\item \cite{Yao-pneui} - PneUIs, creating interfaces with pneumatics
\item \cite{Slyper-shape} - creating silicone bendy things with embedded electronics to sense flexing, stretching, etc., supported by those shapes.
\item \cite{Iwata-volflex} - a display made up of many balloons that inflate and deflate to change the shape
\item \cite{Ono-touchandactivate} - the Touch\'{e} with sound paper from last year's UIST
\item \cite{Follmer-jamming} - Jamming User Interfaces
\item \cite{Kim-inflatablemouse} - a basic mouse, but it inflates so you can store it and also use it more reasonably than a flat mouse
\item \cite{Hashimoto-squirming} - hold a speaker in your hands, and air pressure changes make it feel like you're holidng a living, squirming thing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Misc}
\bjoern{These may not belong in related work, but I'm just collecting them here.}
\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{Wong-cgf11} - Wong presents a graph-based approach for generating continuous line illustrations from images. It's approach of linking edges into a continuous line based on Semi-Eulerization is similar to ours. Prior work used tours of nodes, rather than edges, and cast continuous line drawing as a traveling salesman problem~\cite{Bosch-tsp}.
\item \cite{Schweikardt-tei09} Schweikardt et al. also made a connection between electroluminescent wire and graph theory, though their contribution is orthogonal: they provide a tangible construction kit with smart nodes for building physical graph examples. Edges are lit up by EL wire.
\item \cite{strattman1997neon} - Strattman is the standard "text book" for neon lighting designers.
\item In neon sign making, segments of a tube that should not appear illuminated are covered with opaque paint. This is called "blocking out"\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_sign}}.
